##  One set of solutions

| Issue                     | => One solution
| -----                     | --------
| Performance               | => Move UI generation out of the server
| High duplication          | => Use a version control system (like git)
| Reporting                 | => Open the data thanks to REST APIs
| Bulk edit impossible      | => If no UI, REST APIs or versioned files
| No history                | => Git
| Devs and QAs              | => GitHub
